                            We want more people to know why renewable energy is good. Why ocean pollution is more serious than we think. We want people to know that C02 in the earth’s 
                            atmosphere must be reduced. We want more people to understand that word “Eco-Friendliness” is way more important to us, it’s the key to saving our world.
                            Becoming eco-friendly isn’t really that hard. It simply means having a lifestyle that is better for the environment. 
                            Learning to become eco-friendly is even easier, but it is very important. Sometimes, small steps can make a big difference.

                                    Renewable Energy is way more important than we think. Most commonly used renewable energy sources are Solar, Wind, Hydropower and Geothermal. 
                                    Solar energy is already being used in homes. While new investors with “making energy from moving air” in their mind are showing up constantly.

                                    While leading pollutant entering the oceans is sewage, plastic is a serious issue as well. Over a 90% of plastics are not recycled. 
                                    Corporate giants producing products made from plastic such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Starbucks, McDonald’s are already looking forward for 
                                    producing and delivering goods in a way that respects oceans and this planet.

                                    For industrialized nations like the US, modern life is unthinkable without fossil fuels. These fuels are causing Acid Rains, Climate changes, Air,

                                    health-harming. The combustion process also creates nitrogen oxides that lead to the creation of smog and pneumonia.
