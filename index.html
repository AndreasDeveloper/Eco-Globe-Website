                            We want more people to know why renewable energy is good. Why ocean pollution is more serious than we think. We want people to know that C02 in the earth’s 
                            atmosphere must be reduced. We want more people to understand that word “Eco-Friendliness” is way more important to us, it’s the key to saving our world.
                            Becoming eco-friendly isn’t really that hard. It simply means having a lifestyle that is better for the environment. 
                            Learning to become eco-friendly is even easier, but it is very important. Sometimes, small steps can make a big difference.

                                        and transportation-related activities are responsible for this. Simply buying and using electrical car will reduce these issues. More car companies

                                For industrialized nations like the US, modern life is unthinkable without fossil fuels. By most estimates, coal, oil and natural gas are enough to 
                                supply 85% of America’s energy demand. These fuels are causing Acid Rains, Climate changes, Air, Land and Water pollution in general and they are 
                                health-harming. The combustion process also creates nitrogen oxides that lead to the creation of smog and/or pneumonia. Power Plants and 
                                transportation-related activities are responsible for this. Simply buying and using electrical car will reduce these issues. More car companies are 
                                looking forward to produce and design eco-friendly cars. Leading electric car company in the world is currently Renault-Nissan. Right behind it, 
                                is famous Tesla.

                                Being eco-friendly simply means having a lifestyle that are better for the environment. Learning to be more environmentally friendly is easier than 
                                you think. You don’t have to jump in by changing everything, starting small is more sustainable and it is a part of your normal life. First of all, 
                                be more aware of resources that you use every single day. You can try practicing conservation by turning the lights off as you are leaving the room etc.
                                 As well you can start planting trees at empty landscapes around your home. You can start conserving water, use less fossil fuel based products, 
                                 buy locally grown products etc. We will talk more about this in special section! Read more about it there.
